# Common Mark

Common Mark is the basic markup format adopted for the project.

You should check that your implementation supports:

- _italics_ (using underscores) and *italics* (using stars),

- **bold** (using double stars),

- bulleted lists,

- etc.

The CommonMark spec can be found [online](http://spec.commonmark.org).
